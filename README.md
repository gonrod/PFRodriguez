About This Project
Welcome to the final instance of my thesis-like project for the web development course at Coderhouse.

Now, you might be wondering why on Earth everything here is in English. From the code and comments to the actual content, it's all in English. Well, there's no straightforward answer. It started as a style choice, and then I just rolled with it. Maybe I was inspired by the global language of programming, or perhaps I just wanted to feel fancy. Who knows?

Reflecting on this project, there are countless things I would change if I could start over. First and foremost, actual design planning would have been a brilliant idea. And then there are all those cool Sass functions I intended to use. But alas, my ambition was no match for the mighty powers of procrastination. Perfectionism: 0, Procrastination: 1.

You'll notice a few remnants of my grand plans, like unused functions, mixins and variables. Consider them the fossils of a once-aspirational project. But hey, I did manage to use some! So there's that.

I included a .gitignore file because the project guidelines insisted on it. Spoiler alert: there's nothing to ignore. I kept the original styles.css file because it became my trusty reference during my Sass relearning journey. It's like a nostalgic relic now.

I genuinely hope you find grading this project as entertaining as I found creating it. To bring a touch of regional flair into the beautiful English language, "Thanks for so much, and sorry for so little." (This is a beloved saying in Uruguay. Iâ€™m not entirely sure if it's used in Argentina, but I'm fully committed to this joke now.)

Happy grading, and may the code be with you!
